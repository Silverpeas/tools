# tools
A set of external tools required or suggested to use Silverpeas.

These tools are open-source but they don't provide a binary distribution for Debian and/or CentOS or, more exactly, for the actual stable version of Debian and/or CentOS.

So, this repository provides build scripts to fetch their source, to build them and then to push the binary result to the [Silverpeas Web Site](https://www.silverpeas.org).
